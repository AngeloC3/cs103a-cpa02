### All Songs Page
In the navigation bar, you can click "All Songs" to display a list of every song in the database. There, you can click "Favorite this song!" to add it to your favorites".

### Filtered Page
As an example, if you filtered the songs by the genre, "pop", you would get the following result:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K5-I_5HoUQRyNhxRb_w_85XoUDOrXJQt/view?usp=sharing

On this page, you can click "Favorite this song!" to add a chosen song to your favorites.

### Favorites Page
When on the home page, you can click show favorites. Doing so will bring up a page containing all your favorited songs. On this page, you can click "Unavorite this song" to remove a chosen song from your favorites.
